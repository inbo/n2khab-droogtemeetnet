                        ref = "develop_fv")
library(watina)
?watina

# remotes::install_github("inbo/n2khab",

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
